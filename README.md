# 📈 Financial Econometrics Analysis: Modeling and Forecasting French Stock Returns (2019–2024)

## 📋 Project Overview
This study applies advanced econometric and time‑series methods to model and forecast the returns of three major French stocks—**LVMH, TotalEnergies, and BNP Paribas**—over the turbulent period 2019‑2024. The project combines **financial theory, statistical testing, and machine‑learning techniques** to assess the stability of the CAPM, measure the impact of the COVID‑19 crisis, and evaluate out‑of‑sample forecasting performance.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. **Risk‑return profiling** of each asset using descriptive statistics (volatility, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, skewness, kurtosis).
2. **Estimation of market betas** (CAPM) and testing for structural breaks during the COVID‑19 period.
3. **Dynamic modeling** with AR(1), ARMA, and GARCH‑M specifications.
4. **Out‑of‑sample forecasting** for 2024 using multiple model families.
5. **Strategic implications** for portfolio diversification and dynamic risk management.
